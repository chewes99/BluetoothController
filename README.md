# BluetoothController
## A mobile app used to control a copter via bluetooth
We are currently working on an android app to control a drone via bluetooth.
The controller UI consists of two joysticks, which are responsible for piloting the copter. A mockup can be found [here](https://app.moqups.com/sguertl/jfRWDm1V0m/view).
